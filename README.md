<h1 align="center">C Programming Assignment Guide</h1>

Welcome, junior coders!

This repository contains all the source code you need for your C programming assignments for your **C Programming Lab [ES-CS291]** in the second semester. Let's walk you through how to set up your system and run these `.c` files on **Windows**, **Linux**, or **macOS**.


## What You Need

- A C compiler (like GCC)
- An CE/IDE — I recommend **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**
- Basic terminal or command line access

---

## ⚙️ Setting Up Your Environment

### Step 1: Install VS Code (Windows/macOS/Linux)

1. Go to [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. Download and install VS Code for your operating system
3. Launch VS Code and install the **C/C++ Extension**:
   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+X` → Search for `C/C++` → Click **Install** (by Microsoft)

## Windows Setup

### 🔧 Install GCC Compiler

#### Recommended: Install via MinGW Installation Manager

1. Download from [https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/)
2. Run the installer (`mingw-get-setup.exe`) to install the MinGW Installation Manager
3. Inside the manager:
   - Mark for installation:
     - `mingw32-gcc-g++`
     - `mingw32-base`
     - `mingw32-gcc-objc`
   - Click `Installation → Apply Changes`
4. Add `C:\MinGW\bin` to your **System PATH**:
   - Search "Environment Variables" → Edit PATH → Add the above directory
5. Verify installation:
   
   ```cmd
   gcc --version
   ```

#### Alternative: Install via MSYS2

1. Download MSYS2: [https://www.msys2.org/](https://www.msys2.org/)
2. Install it and run the UCRT64 terminal
3. Update packages:
   
   ```bash
   pacman -Syu
   pacman -Su
   ```
   
4. Install GCC:
   
   ```bash
   pacman -S mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-gcc
   ```

> ⚠️ MSYS2 does **not** automatically add its bin directory to PATH. You must do it manually:
> - Search "Environment Variables" → Edit PATH → Add the chosen directory from below

5. Add the appropriate MSYS2 bin directory to your **System PATH**:
   - For **UCRT64**: `C:\msys64\ucrt64\bin`
   - For **MINGW64**: `C:\msys64\mingw64\bin`
   - For **CLANG64**: `C:\msys64\clang64\bin`

> Also, make sure to use the **MSYS2 MinGW UCRT64 Terminal**, not the default MSYS2 shell.

6. Verify installation:
   
   ```cmd
   gcc --version
   ```

## Linux Setup (All Distros)

### For Ubuntu/Debian-based

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential
```

### For Arch-based (Manjaro/EndeavourOS/etc.)

```bash
sudo pacman -Syu
sudo pacman -S base-devel gcc
```

### For Fedora/RHEL-based

```bash
sudo dnf groupinstall "Development Tools"
sudo dnf install gcc
```

Verify installation:

```bash
gcc --version
```

---

## macOS Setup

1. Open Terminal
2. Install the Xcode Command Line Tools:
   
   ```bash
   xcode-select --install
   ```
   
3. Verify installation:
   
   ```bash
   gcc --version
   ```

## Writing and Running C Programs

### Write/Edit Your Code

- Open your `.c` file in **VS Code** to view and edit the code
- Create a new file and save it with a `.c` extension to create your own C file

### 🛠️ Compile & Run

Use the integrated terminal in VS Code (`Ctrl + `` `) or system terminal.

#### Windows (MinGW or MSYS2)

```cmd
gcc filename.c -o filename.exe -lm
./filename.exe
```

#### Linux / macOS

```bash
gcc filename.c -o filename -lm
./filename
```

> Replace `filename.c` with your actual file name. The `-lm` flag links the math library (needed for functions like `sqrt`, `pow`, etc.).

## VS Code Tips for Beginners

1. Open your folder containing `.c` files in VS Code (`File → Open Folder`)
2. Open the terminal inside VS Code:
   - `Ctrl + ~` (tilde) or `View → Terminal`
3. Compile and run as shown above
4. **Optional but easier:** Install the [Code Runner](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.code-runner) extension  
   - After installing, you can run your `.c` file directly with:
     - Right-click → **Run Code**  
     - Or use the shortcut `Ctrl + Alt + N`  
   - Keybinds for Code Runner can be changed anytime from **VS Code Preferences → Keyboard Shortcuts**  
   - This saves you from manually typing `gcc` commands each time
5. VS Code also provides a ▶️ run/debug button in the top-right (after installing the C/C++ extension).  
   - However, the built-in debugger is often **frustrating for beginners** because it requires correct setup of `tasks.json` and `launch.json`, and behaves differently across platforms (Windows MinGW vs Linux vs macOS).  
   - Common issues include wrong paths, missing compiler configs, or limitations in GDB/LLDB that cause breakpoints or stepping to fail.  
   - Recommended approach: stick to **Code Runner** or **manual compilation** for a more stable experience when starting out.

> 🛠️ **First Time Only**: When you click the run button or set up debugging for the first time in a project, VS Code will prompt you to select a compiler.  
>   - Select **`GCC (MinGW)`** if you're on Windows with MinGW  
>   - Select **`g++`** or **`gcc`** based on your platform and installation  
>   - This sets up your `tasks.json` and `launch.json` files automatically

## Common Errors & Fixes

| Error Message            | Reason / Fix                                              |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `gcc not found`          | Install GCC properly, and ensure it's in PATH (Windows)  |
| `Permission denied`      | On Linux/macOS, use `chmod +x filename`                  |
| Program closes instantly | run from terminal (not double-click) |
